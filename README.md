# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project consists of a frontend and a backend component designed to monitor and manage driver alerts effectively. The backend uses a mock server powered by `json-server`, which simulates a REST API with a JSON database. The frontend is built with React and utilizes various libraries for UI and functionality enhancements.

### Backend

The backend leverages `json-server` to create a mock REST API. `json-server` provides a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds, making it ideal for prototyping and testing frontend applications.

**Command to run the backend:**

`npm run server`

### Frontend

The frontend of the project is developed using React and employs Tailwind CSS for styling. For handling dates and times, the application utilizes the `dayjs` library, which provides a simple and lightweight solution. Additionally, `react-select` is used for enhanced select input components, offering a customizable and feature-rich experience. The project also uses React Icons for any icon-related elements, such as notifications.
**Command to run the frontend:**

`npm start`

This command initiates the React application, serving the user interface on the default web browser. If further modifications or additions are needed in the documentation to cover more details or features, please feel free to update.
